# workday-schedular
## Here is a workday-schedular that updates every minute to let you know where you are in the day!
## We are using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and Bootstrap.
## You can type in each time block your task, and then hit the save button.  It will save it to local storage.
## When you refresh the page, your tasks stay on the page.
## Hope this makes life just a little bit easier!
